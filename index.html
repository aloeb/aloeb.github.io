								</header>
								<p>
									Hello! My name is Adam Loeb, and I am currently a second year Junior
									at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I would say I have a
									passion for technology, so you'll find me constantly working on some
									new, cool project. When I'm not working on one of those or trying to
									keep up my 4.0 GPA, I enjoy practicing my trumpet, climbing, or even
									golfing on occasion! Feel free to check out some of my projects or my
									resume by using the buttons above!

								<p>
									Interested in the kind of stuff I do? Well you can check it all out here!
									It's pretty much a basic list of my bigger more successful projects. You
									can check out other projects of mine on GitHub. I've listed them in order
									of importance (in my mind), so they aren't nessessarily chronological.

											<p class="desc">
												Just 25 was my very first, and most successful (so far), Android app. I made it with
												a friend, and it was a blast! We were just learning Android at the time, so we are
												just now trying to go back and polish it up a bit! Feel free to check it out by
												clicking on the picture!

										</div>
										<div class="8u">
											<p class="desc">
												For my Sofware Engineering course, my team of six made a social media app, OneUp! It was on iOS and Android, and  
												the premise is that you can set records around you, then "OneUp" other's records 
												to introduce a little competition into everyday life. Development has paused for the 
												summer, but we may be picking it back up come fall to clean things up. The coolest 
												feature I got to work on was live video filters (like stopwatches and the like). I'm 
												definitely going to see if I can polish up the code and make it work even better.

												Flappy bird was a super fun iOS keyboard I made. I was really hoping to release 
												it to the iOS store, but it was rejected for not actually inputing text. Go figure.

										<div class="8u">
											<p class="desc">
												Tempo has been my favorite hackathon project so far! It's been shown that people
												can exercise more effectively when syncing their movements to music. We set
												out to simplify the process by syncing music to people's movements. Utilizing the Pebble
												and the Spotify API, we were able to intelligently select music as you moved around.
												Whether you want to use it while running, or just going for a stroll, the app could
												match your tempo every time!

										</div>
										<div class="8u">
											<p class="desc">
												Fruitful Feats was my second Android app! This one was made by a team of seven which
												I project managed. But I didn't just project manage! I also did a bunch of coding on
												this project. The organization was one big challenge, but the biggest challenge was the
												time contraints! Most of us were leaving for college, so we only had five weeks to make
												the app work and look good! Although it's not perfect, I'm happy with the final product
												given our timeframe. Check it out by clicking the image!

										</div>
										<div class="8u">
											<p class="desc">
												TypeMuse is the typing tutorial the world needs! No more boring tutorials where you
												type words for hours on end! TypeMuse lets you type along to the lyrics of your
												favorite songs while the tunes play in the background. This project actually won
												the TechOlympics Showcase, placed first at the UC 2014 IT Expo, and went on to win a 2015 statewide business pitch competition! We wanted to
												continue development and potentially release TypeMuse to the public, but unfortunately,
												the high costs and legal implications that went along with using copyrighted music
												ended up being more than what we wanted to deal with.

											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_logo.jpg" alt=""></a>
										</div>
										<div class="8u">
											<p class="desc">
												MealMatchr was a cool iOS app that my team created at my first Hackathon,
												BoilerMake. The app would quickly connect you with students with similar interests
												in the closest dining court so that you could meet new people and avoid
												dining alone when all of your friends were busy in class! The app was written
												entirely in Swift with a PHP/MySQL backend. I took care of all the application code
												as I had the most experience with mobile development.

										<div class="8u">
											<p class="desc">
												Halfway through my senior year in high school, I saw a problem. Logging into the
												school's grades website was a hassel and took way longer than it should have. In
												addition, the interface was not designed for mobile, and what was a student to do
												if they did not have a smart phone? My solution was Grade Texts! Written in C#, this
												server side app would go through a list of students and send them their grades on a
												regular basis. I even got to meet and propose my app to the school district's IT
												department!
